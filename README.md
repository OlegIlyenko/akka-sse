[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hseeberger/akka-sse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hseeberger/akka-sse)

akka-sse adds support for [Server-Sent Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/#event-stream-interpretation SSE specification) (SSE) to akka-http.

## Installation

akka-sse depends on akka-http 1.0-RC1.

Grab it while it's hot:

``` scala
// All releases including intermediate ones are published here,
// final ones are also published to Maven Central.
resolvers += "hseeberger at bintray" at "http://dl.bintray.com/hseeberger/maven"

libraryDependencies ++= List(
  "de.heikoseeberger" %% "akka-sse" % "0.10.0",
  ...
)
```

## Usage

First, mix `EventStreamMarshalling` into your request handling classes or actors, e.g.:

``` scala
class HttpService
    extends Actor
    with Directives
    with EventStreamMarshalling { ... }
```

Then, define an implicit view from your domain events to `ServerSentEvent`s, e.g.:

``` scala
implicit def flowEventToServerSentEvent(event: Flow.Event): ServerSentEvent =
  event match {
    case messageAdded: Flow.MessageAdded =>
      val data = PrettyPrinter(jsonWriter[Flow.MessageAdded].write(messageAdded))
      ServerSentEvent(data, "added")
  }
```

Finally, simply complete a request to get an SSE stream with a `akka.stream.scaladsl.Source` of your domain events, e.g.:

``` scala
private def messages: Route =
  path("messages") {
    get {
      complete {
        Source(ActorPublisher[Flow.Event](createFlowEventPublisher()))
      }
    }
  }
```

There's also early support for consuming server-side events via `EventStreamUnmarshalling`. Take a look at the example project for details.

A complete demo using akka-sse is [Reactive Flows](https://github.com/hseeberger/reactive-flows).
Have fun, and please report any issues, suggestions, complaints.
